The tast for this project is to implement a C program that solves the Sudoku puzzle using recursive backtracking. A standard Sudoku puzzle contains 81 cells, in a 9 by 9 grid, and has 9 zones. Each zone is the intersection of 3 rows and 3 columns (e.g. size 3x3). Each cell may contain a number from 1 to 9 and each number can only occur once in each 3x3 zone, row, and column of the grid. At the beginning of the game, several cells begin with numbers, and the goal is to fill in the remaining cells with numbers satisfying the puzzle rule.
